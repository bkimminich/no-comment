# // No Comment!
/* about the worthlessness of comments in clean code */

> "Comments are - at best - a necessary evil" (Uncle Bob, "Clean Code") - Over the years I gathered quite a collection of examples for bad code comments. The most precious gems among them I would like to share with you. You will listen in on developer monologues and dialogues, try to analyze cryptic bylines, experience different levels of UnCamelCasing(tm) skill and fight your way through a redundant, useless and misleading inline thicket. You will also hear about well-meant tools and plugins that should not even exist if the motto "No Comment!" would be valued as it should be.
